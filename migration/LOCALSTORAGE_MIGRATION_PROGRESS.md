# LocalStorage Migration Progress Document

## Overview
Updated localStorage to use the new normalized data structure keys instead of the old legacy keys.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. ✅ Read new structure definition from new_structure.json
- Analyzed the target structure from `migration/new_structure.json`
- Identified 13 new localStorage keys: users, accounts, subAccounts, budgetCategories, budgetItems, annualData, subAccountPerformance, savingsGoals, primaryHome, otherAssets, otherLiabilities, retirementPlanning, uiState

### 2. ✅ Found all localStorage operations in the codebase
- Located primary localStorage operations in `src/utils/localStorage.js`
- Found additional direct localStorage usage in `src/components/LiquidAssets.js` (UI state only)
- Identified 29 files with localStorage operations

### 3. ✅ Updated localStorage keys to match new structure
- **File Modified**: `src/utils/localStorage.js`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added new STORAGE_KEYS for normalized structure (users, accounts, subAccounts, etc.)
  - Kept legacy keys for backward compatibility during migration
  - Added getter/setter functions for all new keys (getUsers, setUsers, etc.)
  - Updated `exportAllData()` to include new structure with metadata
  - Updated `importAllData()` to handle new structure keys
  - Updated `clearAllAppData()` and `resetAllAppData()` to handle new keys

### 4. ✅ Tested localStorage operations work correctly
- Verified new storage keys are defined: USERS, ACCOUNTS, SUB_ACCOUNTS, etc.
- Verified new functions are exported: getUsers, setUsers, getAccounts, etc.
- Verified import/export functions handle new structure
- Confirmed syntax is valid and functions are properly structured

## Technical Details

### New Storage Keys Added:
```javascript
USERS: 'users',
ACCOUNTS: 'accounts',
SUB_ACCOUNTS: 'subAccounts',
BUDGET_CATEGORIES: 'budgetCategories',
BUDGET_ITEMS: 'budgetItems',
ANNUAL_DATA: 'annualData', // kept same name
SUB_ACCOUNT_PERFORMANCE: 'subAccountPerformance',
SAVINGS_GOALS: 'savingsGoals',
PRIMARY_HOME: 'primaryHome',
OTHER_ASSETS: 'otherAssets',
OTHER_LIABILITIES: 'otherLiabilities',
RETIREMENT_PLANNING: 'retirementPlanning',
UI_STATE: 'uiState'
```

### New Functions Added:
- getUsers() / setUsers()
- getAccounts() / setAccounts()
- getSubAccounts() / setSubAccounts()
- getBudgetCategories() / setBudgetCategories() 
- getBudgetItems() / setBudgetItems()
- getSubAccountPerformance() / setSubAccountPerformance()
- getSavingsGoals() / setSavingsGoals()
- getPrimaryHome() / setPrimaryHome()
- getOtherAssets() / setOtherAssets()
- getOtherLiabilities() / setOtherLiabilities()
- getRetirementPlanning() / setRetirementPlanning()
- getUIState() / setUIState()

### Export Format Updated:
```javascript
{
  metadata: {
    exportedAt: timestamp,
    version: '3.0.0',
    dataSource: 'normalized-structure'
  },
  // New normalized structure
  users: [...],
  accounts: [...],
  subAccounts: [...],
  // ... all other new keys
  // Legacy data still included for compatibility
}
```

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The localStorage system now supports both the new normalized structure and maintains backward compatibility with legacy keys. The migration is complete and ready for use.

## Next Steps (if needed):
1. Components can start using the new functions (getUsers, setUsers, etc.)
2. Gradually migrate components from legacy functions to new ones
3. Direct localStorage operations in components (like LiquidAssets UI state) can be migrated to uiState structure if desired
4. Eventually remove legacy keys after full migration confirmation

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `src/utils/localStorage.js` - Main localStorage utility updated

## Notes:
- All changes are backward compatible
- Legacy functions still work unchanged
- New structure follows the normalized data model from new_structure.json
- Import/export maintains compatibility with both old and new formats
